After changing the credentials you need to deploy them into pcf 

612 services --> DevOpsPipelines --> createUpdatePCFServices --> build with params --> select appropriate

if there are only config file changes(without any code changes in the app) --> 212 services --> applications --> estaranalytics
--> build with params --> select release ---> build ( while building pipeline, if you get the branch name select release --> on the left side at the start of build you can see no of commits and you can check them)
